Topic: CASE + GROUP BY

Task: Write a query that gives an overview of how many films have replacements costs in the following cost ranges

low: 9.99 - 19.99

medium: 20.00 - 24.99

high: 25.00 - 29.99

Question: How many films have a replacement cost in the "low" group?

SOLUTION:
SELECT 
CASE 
WHEN replacement_cost BETWEEN '9.99' AND '19.99'
THEN 'low'
WHEN replacement_cost<='24.99'
THEN 'medium'
WHEN replacement_cost<='29.99'
THEN 'high'
END AS cost,
COUNT(*)
from film
GROUP BY cost
HAVING CASE 
WHEN replacement_cost BETWEEN '9.99' AND '19.99'
THEN 'low'
WHEN replacement_cost<='24.99'
THEN 'medium'
WHEN replacement_cost<='29.99'
THEN 'high'
END='low';
