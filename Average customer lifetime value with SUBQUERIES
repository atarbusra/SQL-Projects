--Task: Create a list that shows the "average customer lifetime value" grouped by the different districts.

--Example:
--If there are two customers in "District 1" where one customer has a total (lifetime) spent of $1000 and the second customer has a total spent of $2000 then the "average customer lifetime spent" in this district is $1500.

--So, first, you need to calculate the total per customer and then the average of these totals per district.

--Question: Which district has the highest average customer lifetime value?
--SOLUTION:

SELECT ROUND(AVG(rev_per_customer),2) AS avg_lifetime_value 
,a.district 
FROM (SELECT customer_id, 
	    SUM(amount) as rev_per_customer
	    FROM payment 
	    GROUP BY customer_id) AS subquery
INNER JOIN customer cu
ON cu.customer_id=subquery.customer_id
INNER JOIN address a
ON a.address_id=cu.address_id
GROUP BY a.district
ORDER BY avg_lifetime_value DESC;
